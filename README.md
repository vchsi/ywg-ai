### Your watch expert, now in AI ###

YWG.ai (Your Watch Guy) uses AI to find the best selection of watches for you to buy or gift. Through learning your preferences through a few quick, easy surveys, YWG's servers can compile a easy-to-read report contaning all the data you need to purchase.

## Our techstack ##:

YWG.ai uses Google Gemini 2.5flash (through google-genai) and Google Images Search (through google-cse) to create the reports. Front end is handled through traditional JavaScript and JQuery, while the back end uses Flask. 

SQLite is currently being used to store data, but I hope to change it to MYSQL for better performance and scalability.
